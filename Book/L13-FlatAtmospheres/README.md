# L13 Flat Atmospheres

Week 7, Tuesday


## Material covered and references

We applied the formal solution of RT to a semi-infinite, flat atmosphere. We found an expression for the in-going ($u<0$) and out-going ($u>0$) rays. 
In the case of the Sun, we are able to measure the emergent intensity ($\tau = 0$) as a function of $u$. This can therefore be used to constrain the source function and hence the temperature.
