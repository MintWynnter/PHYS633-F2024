# L11 Source Function

Week 6, Tuesday

Notebook: L11-SourceFunction-template.ipynb

## Material covered and references

The change in intensity in the case of pure emission (the solution is a quite simple, straight integral, for once!).

Micro-objectives
- I can list the two different ways that intensity can be gained going through matter
- I can list and describe the factors that contributes to an element of emission ($dI$)
- I can derive the equation for intensity as a function of position $I(s)$, and I can calculate and sketch it if given a functional form for the characteristics of the matter (e.g. $\rho(s)$, $\kappa(s)$, etc).

* The formal solution of the radiative transfer equation. This solution is expressed in terms of the optical depth $\tau$, and make use of a quantity called the source function $S_\lambda = j_\lambda/\kappa_\lambda$, and has units of intensity.
 
* The source function is what the intensity will become after going through a number of optical depth. Of course, the intensity might not be able to become equal to the source function, if the source function itself varies significantly over a few optical depth. 

Micro-objectives:
- I can state and explain all of the terms in the formal solution of radiative transfer.
- I can derive the equation for the solution of radiative transfer for constant density, opacity, and source function, starting from the formal solution.
- I can make a sketch of $I(s)$ for constant density, opacity, and source function.
- I can calculate the solution for $I(s)$ if given a simple functional form for e.g. $\rho(s)$ or $S(\tau)$.
