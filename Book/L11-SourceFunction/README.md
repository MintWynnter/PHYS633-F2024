* The formal solution of the radiative transfer equation. This solution is expressed in terms of the optical depth $\tau$, and make use of a quantity called the source function $S_\lambda = j_\lambda/\kappa_\lambda$, and has units of intensity.
 
* The source function is what the intensity will become after going through a number of optical depth. Of course, the intensity might not be able to become equal to the source function, if the source function itself varies significantly over a few optical depth.
