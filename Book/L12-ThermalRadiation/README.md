# L12 Thermal Radiation

Week 6, Thursday


## Material covered and references

Properties of "blackbodies" objects. From the energy distribution of photon inside of the BB cavity, we found:
* The total energy density
* The distribution of photon's frequency and wavelength (beware of the conversion)
* That the intensity of the light inside the cavity was equal to the Planck function
* that the flux inside of the cavity is zero
* that the flux at the surface of a BB (light going through the "hole") is $\sigma T^4$.

* In the case of a pure thermal radiation at a single temperature, there is no change in intensity such that $S_\lambda = I_\lambda$.
* But in the case of LTE, the temperature gradient means that the intensity $I_\lambda$ is not always $B_\lambda$, if the source function changes within a few optical depths. However, locally the source function can be approximated by $S_\lambda \simeq I_\lambda$ if scattering processes are much less important than pure absorption processes.

We explored the frequency dependence of the opacity and its effect on the frequency dependence of the intensity exiting a slab of material with $S_\lambda=B_\lambda(T)$. We can link these with the type of spectra described by the Kirchhoff's law of spectroscopy.
