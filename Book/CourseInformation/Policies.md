# Course-specific policies and Code of Conduct

## Course Policies

Please silence your cell phones before class. Computers and/or tablets will be needed in this course. Unfortunately, these also comes with a lot of distracting possibilities. Please be mindful to minimize distractions to you, your fellow students, and me.

If for any reason, at any time during the semester, you find yourself confused or falling behind, please let me know immediately. We can work together to find a way for you to succeed.


**Collaboration** on your portefolio is allowed and encouraged. For example, meeting together in a group to figure out a problem is an excellent idea. However, unless specified, **all submitted work must be your own using your own words and explanations** -- you should be able to readily explain to me in person how to solve each problem.

Students are not allowed to use advanced automated tools (artificial intelligence or machine learning tools such as ChatGPT or Dall-E 2) on assignments in this course. Each student is expected to complete each assignment without substantive assistance from others, including automated tools.

Academic dishonesty, including cheating, plagiarism, and fabrication is a serious offense that will result in contacting the Dean of Students and others according to campus policy. The policy, procedures, and charges can be found at: [https://www1.udel.edu/studentconduct/ai.html](https://www1.udel.edu/studentconduct/ai.html).

I do not take **attendance** in class. If you miss a class, it will be your responsability to catch up with the material covered (especially the part of the notebook that was done together in class). 

Absences on religious holidays listed in university calendars are recognized as an excused absence. Nevertheless, you are urged to remind me of your intention to be absent on a particular upcoming holiday. Absences on religious holidays not listed in university calendars, as well as absences due to athletic participation or other extracurricular activities in which you are an official representative of the university, shall be recognized as excused absences when you inform me in writing during the first two weeks of the semester of these planned absences for the semester.




## Code of Conduct

Diversity is considered a resource that enriches us culturally and intellectually in this class. No instances of harassment or attempts to marginalize students will be tolerated in this class. Be respectful and collaborate instead of competing: everyone, including you, will benefit from it. If you have concerns please come talk to me. 

The following Code of Conduct applies to all interactions of members of this class in the context of the course, online and offline, including social media, mailing lists, forums, meetings, labs, slack, canvas, and one-to-one interactions.

* All members of the class should be treated with respect regardless of personal attributes, including but not limited to: race, ethnicity, gender or gender identity, physical appearance, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political affiliation or opinions, sexual preference, caregiver status, age, nationality, language.
* Harassment, verbal or physical, are not tolerated. Keep in mind that what is acceptable to one person may not be acceptable to another.
* Bullying, including physical bullying, exclusion, marginalization, disparagement, or intimidation, is not tolerated.
* All members of the class are empowered to request that an undesirable behavior is dismissed.
* Own your intention but also own your impact: all members are expected to immediately stop any behavior inconsistent with the Code of Conduct regardless of original intent.

This Code of Conduct supplements, and does not overwrite, the Codes of Conduct that you are bound to in your role at UDel. For example here is the [UDel students' CoC](http://www1.udel.edu/stuguide/18-19/code.html) 

Please do raise any concerns to me -- The best way is to contact me on slack, or by email.

I expect to see a supportive, collaborative attitude from all students to assure we maintain and foster a learning environment that leads to rigor, excellence, and happiness. This includes:

* be mindful of cultural norms. Make sure you know how your classmates want to be addressed (e.g. ask their preferred pronoun; mine is she/her/hers). Do not interrupt your classmates while they are speaking, do not speak over classmates and be aware and respectful of the natural volume of their voice. Be respectful of individual communication skills and fluency in the common languages we speak.
* be available, within reason, to share knowledge and do so respectfully. Never make a classmate feel bad for not knowing something you already know. It is not your role to assess your classmates' efforts or knowledge. If you feel like supporting a teammate is getting in the way of your productivity in groupwork, bring this concern to me directly.
* be conscientious and value your classmates and instructors time when asking for help. Make sure you have done your share of weight lifting: you have reviewed the resources available to the class and looked around for answers when applicable. 
* prepare yourself to receive help: be prepared to ask clear questions and to be able to show and demonstrate the issues you are having. Your classmates should not be expected to struggle to understand what your problem or question is
* be on time for class


Every day I try to remind myself of all these norms, but I do too fail to respect them at times. If you notice that I have not followed any of these rules, or you think I am adopting behaviors that make you uncomfortable please promptly let me know!
