Course websites: 

* Most class material is grouped in this Github repository (if you cloned the repository locally on your computer, make sure to fetch it regularly)
* Canvas will be used to track grades, submit assignments for grading, and for private information. I will also use it to host videos sporadically. 
* Large data files will be shared through Google Drive links.
* A Slack workspace will be available for general class communication. 

**Course description**: Introduction to the physics of stellar interiors and atmospheres. The evolution of stars is explored by studying the changes in internal composition due to nuclear reactions. The physical processes underlying stellar spectra are investigated. Computer simulations of stars and their atmospheres will be used.

Note: During this course, we will use Python Notebooks on Google Colab (freeware) during lectures to produce graphs and perform calculations -- **please bring your laptop at every lectures**.

**Background knowledge**: There is no official pre-requisite for this course, because it is at the graduate level. I expect good knowledge equivalent to PHYS207 Fundamentals of Physics I, PHYS310 Thermodynamics, and PHYS309 20th/21st Century Physics. For mathematics, calculus in very important (infinitesimal quantities, definite integration, and differential equation solutions). 

## About your instructor
My main area of research is stellar physics, more specifically the study of massive stars, their stellar winds, and their magnetic fields. I use spectroscopy and spectropolatimetry at many wavelengths, and regularly use data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope. My goal for this course is not only to give you a strong understanding of the key physical principles that govern the life of stars, but also to give you a taste of the outstanding questions that have yet to be answered and are currently the subject to active research.

## Welcome to Stellar Astrophysics!

Astrophysics is a fascinating topic. Even after a decade of research in this field, I am still amazed on how we can tell so much about these faint white dots in the sky, with a good telescope and more importantly with our knowledge of physics.

Even though you are all here because at some level you love space, you probably do not all aspire to become astronomers. However, I will say that stellar astrophysics is one of the best subjects to learn how we integrate what seems to be very different aspects of physics to solve a problem in a given topic. This is very important skills for a physicist in any career path.

## Policies

Please silence your cell phones before class. Computers and/or tablets will be needed in this course. Unfortunately, these also comes with a lot of distracting possibilities. Please be mindful to minimize distractions to you, your fellow students, and me.

If for any reason, at any time during the semester, you find yourself confused or falling behind, please let me know immediately. We can work together to find a way for you to succeed.


**Collaboration** on your portefolio is allowed and encouraged. For example, meeting together in a group to figure out a problem is an excellent idea. However, unless specified, **all submitted work must be your own using your own words and explanations** -- you should be able to readily explain to me in person how to solve each problem.

Academic dishonesty, including cheating, plagiarism, and fabrication is a serious offense that will result in contacting the Dean of Students and others according to campus policy. The policy, procedures, and charges can be found at: [https://www1.udel.edu/studentconduct/ai.html](https://www1.udel.edu/studentconduct/ai.html).

## Code of Conduct

Diversity is considered a resource that enriches us culturally and intellectually in this class. No instances of harassment or attempts to marginalize students will be tolerated in this class. Be respectful and collaborate instead of competing: everyone, including you, will benefit from it. If you have concerns please come talk to me 

The following Code of Conduct applies to all interactions of members of this class in the context of the course, online and offline, including social media, mailing lists, forums, meetings, labs, slack, canvas, and one-to-one interactions.

* All members of the class should be treated with respect regardless of personal attributes, including but not limited to: race, ethnicity, gender or gender identity, physical appearance, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political affiliation or opinions, sexual preference, caregiver status, age, nationality, language.
* Harassment, verbal or physical, are not tolerated. Keep in mind that what is acceptable to one person may not be acceptable to another.
* Bullying, including physical bullying, exclusion, marginalization, disparagement, or intimidation, is not tolerated.
* All members of the class are empowered to request that an undesirable behavior is dismissed.
* Own your intention but also own your impact: all members are expected to immediately stop any behavior inconsistent with the Code of Conduct regardless of original intent.

This Code of Conduct supplements, and does not overwrite, the Codes of Conduct that you are bound to in your role at UDel. For example here is the [UDel students' CoC](http://www1.udel.edu/stuguide/18-19/code.html) 

Please do raise any concerns to me -- The best way is to contact me on slack, or by email.

I expect to see a supportive, collaborative attitude from all students to assure we maintain and foster a learning environment that leads to rigor, excellence, and happiness. This includes:

* be mindful of cultural norms. Make sure you know how your classmates want to be addressed (e.g. ask their preferred pronoun; mine is she/her/hers). Do not interrupt your classmates while they are speaking, do not speak over classmates and be aware and respectful of the natural volume of their voice. Be respectful of individual communication skills and fluency in the common languages we speak.
* be available, within reason, to share knowledge and do so respectfully. Never make a classmate feel bad for not knowing something you already know. It is not your role to assess your classmates' efforts or knowledge. If you feel like supporting a teammate is getting in the way of your productivity in groupwork, bring this concern to me directly.
* be conscientious and value your classmates and instructors time when asking for help. Make sure you have done your share of weight lifting: you have reviewed the resources available to the class and looked around for answers when applicable. 
* prepare yourself to receive help: be prepared to ask clear questions and to be able to show and demonstrate the issues you are having. Your classmates should not be expected to struggle to understand what your problem or question is
* be on time for class


Every day I try to remind myself of all these norms, but I do too fail to respect them at times. If you notice that I have not followed any of these rules, or you think I am adopting behaviors that make you uncomfortable please promptly let me know!
