# UD Academic Policies

(Obtained from UD syllabus template 8/15/2024)

## The Safety of Our Learning Environment 
Student learning can only occur when students and their instructors feel safe, respected, and supported by each other. To ensure that our learning environment is as safe as possible, you are expected to abide by the most up-to-date [University of Delaware’s COVID-19 Guidelines](https://www.udel.edu/home/coronavirus/guidelines/). 

## Academic Honesty

Please familiarize yourself with UD policies regarding academic dishonesty. The [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.udel.edu/content/dam/udelImages/student-life/StudentGuide.pdf) states: “Students must be honest and forthright in their academic studies. Students are expected to do their own work and must give proper credit for any work not their own. Students may neither give nor receive unauthorized assistance.  Engaging in academic dishonesty, or allowing other students to do the same, corrupts the educational process and diminishes the quality of a University of Delaware degree.” View the [university's procedures](https://www.udel.edu/students/community-standards/conduct-process/) for resolving academic dishonesty concerns. Contact Community Standards & Conflict Resolution at communitystandards@udel.edu or (302) 831-2117.

## Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct
The University of Delaware works to promote an academic and work environment that is free from all forms of discrimination, including harassment and sexual misconduct. As a member of the community, your rights, resources and responsibilities are reflected in the Non-Discrimination, Sexual Misconduct, and Title IX policy.  Please familiarize yourself with this policy at the [University’s Office of Equity & Inclusion’s website](https://sites.udel.edu/oei/). You can report any concerns to the University’s Office of Equity & Inclusion (302) 831-8063 or at titleixcoordinator@udel.edu.  you can report anonymously through UD Police (302) 831-2222 or the [EthicsPoint Compliance Hotline](https://sites.udel.edu/intaudit/compliance-hotline/).

## Faculty Statement on Disclosures of Instances of Sexual Misconduct
If, at any time during this course, I happen to be made aware that a student may have been the victim of sexual misconduct (including sexual harassment, sexual violence, domestic/dating violence, or stalking), I am a responsible employee, which means I am directed to report any incident of sexual harassment or misconduct to the University’s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator will then meet with the student to discuss how the University will respond to the report and the student’s rights and options, to offer resources, and to ensure that the student and the campus community are safe. If such a situation is disclosed to me in class, in a paper assignment, or in office hours, I promise to protect your privacy--I will not disclose the incident to anyone but the Title IX Coordinator in a confidential manner. 

For more information on Sexual Misconduct policies, where to get help, and reporting information, please refer to www.udel.edu/sexualmisconduct. You can also send an email to the Title IX Coordinator at titleixcoordinator@udel.edu. At UD, we provide 24/7/365 crisis assistance and victim advocacy and counseling. Contact 302-831-1001 to get in touch with a sexual offense support advocate, as well as confidential and anonymous counseling services for other concerns.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
Any student who may need disability-related accommodations should contact the Office of Disability Support Services (DSS) office as soon as possible. For more information, please visit [Getting Registered at DSS](https://sites.udel.edu/dss/students/registration-process-2/). Contact DSS by phone: 302-831-4643; fax: 302-831-3261; website: www.udel.edu/dss; email: dssoffice@udel.edu; or visit 240 Academy Street, Alison Hall Suite 130 during business hours (8-5 M-F).
