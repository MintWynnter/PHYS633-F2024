# L15 Flux in flat atmospheres

Week 9, Tuesday


## Material covered and references


We generally cannot use Limb-Darkening measurement for stars other than our Sun, as we cannot resolve their surface (but see e.g. [here](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1996ApJ...459..278M&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;type=PRINTER&amp;filetype=.pdf).

However, we know that the total flux (integrated over all wavelengths) should be equal to $\sigma*T_\mathrm{eff}^4$ (60 MW/m2) at all layers.
We use the formal solution to find an expression for the $F(\lambda)$, which is the integral over all optical depth of the source function multiplied by an Exponential integral function (see illustration in slides).
